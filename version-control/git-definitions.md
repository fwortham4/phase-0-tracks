# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  allows you to work on and adding different verisons off of a single master file. Why is it useful? Useful when working on projects with a team of developers working on different applications of code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy of the master file that can be altered and the eventually mergered back into the master, if you so choose.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point for version control that's tells version control when changes have been made. A good commit message tells another developer exactly  what you have changed from the initial or most recent commit.

* What is a merge conflict? A "merge conflict" occurs when two teammates change the same line of code in their separate repositories and then try to merge both repositories with the master file.
