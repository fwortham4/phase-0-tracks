2.) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

QUERY:
SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT:
1|Apple Inc.|AAPL|97.92|1|Forrest|Wortham|25|fwortham4|password1234|1|4|Apple stocks have been in decline recently. Sell, sell, SELL!!!|1|1

2|Alphabet Inc.|GOOGL|735.86|2|Jim|Bob|28|jb123|123456seven|5|5|Google is where it is at!|2|2

3.) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

QUERY:
SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, stars, comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses, users ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT:
Apple Inc.|Forrest|Wortham|4|Apple stocks have been in decline recently. Sell, sell, SELL!!!
Apple Inc.|Billy|Williamson|5|fwortham4 is stupid. Buy low Sell high!
Microsoft Corp|Sally|Sue|5|Microsoft gear is effecient and cheap
Amazon.com, Inc.|Jim|Bob|1|Alexa doesn't understand me and is terrible.
Alphabet Inc.|Jim|Bob|5|Google is where it is at!


4.) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

QUERY:(business_id = 3 is for Amazon.com, Inc.)
SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND businesses.id=3 AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT:
3|Amazon.com, Inc.|AMAZN|725.54|2|Jim|Bob|28|jb123|123456seven|4|1|Alexa doesn't understand me and is terrible.|3|2
