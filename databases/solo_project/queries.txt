8.3 Solo Project - Queries
by Forrest Wortham

1.) Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM free_agents;

2.) Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE free_agents SET last_season_salary=20.0 WHERE lastname_firstname=“Conely_Mike”;

3.) Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT * FROM free_agents, teams WHERE free_agents.team_id = teams.id;

4.) Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT free_agents.lastname_firstname, teams.team_name FROM free_agents JOIN teams ON free_agents.team_id = teams.id;

5.) Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM free_agents WHERE last_season_per<15.0;
